Welcome to FeatureMC!

About
_________________________________
This Tool was developed to check
collaboration-related uncertainties on
context feature models.
With the help of the user interface it is possible to create a model.
The developed tool then translates the Model into Java Objects.
After that the feature models and the constraints are translated into a
Boolean formula with the Java Library LogicNG.
Afterwards LogicNG checks the validity of the Boolean formula.

How to Use
________________________________
After you have created a new project, it is possible to create a model.
Alternatively, an existing model can also be loaded.
After the model is finished, the model can be checked with the help of the "Check" button.
After that the tool will check the models and the constraints.
You can see then the Boolean formula and its result in the console.
If the models and the constraints are valid the tool shows TRUE,
if not the tool shows FALSE.
